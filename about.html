        <h3>About the Show's Creation</h3>
        <p>Adventure Time is an American fantasy animated television series created by Pendleton Ward for Cartoon Network. Produced by Pendleton Ward, Adam Muto and Fred Seibert for Frederator Studios and Cartoon Network Studios. The series is based on a 2007 short produced for Seibert's animation incubator series "Random! Cartoons" at Nickelodeon Animation and aired on Nicktoons. After the short became a viral hit on the Internet, Nickelodeon's executives passed on it before Cartoon Network commissioned a full-length series from Seibert and Ward, which previewed on March 11, 2010. The show premiered on Cartoon Network on April 5, 2010 and ended on September 3, 2018.</p>

        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <p>Adventure Time follows the adventures of a boy named Finn the Human, and his best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog, who has magical powers to change shape and size at will. Finn and Jake live in the post-apocalyptic Land of Ooo, which was ravaged by a cataclysmic event known as the "Mushroom War", a nuclear war that destroyed civilization a thousand years before the series' events. Throughout the series, Finn and Jake interact with major characters, including Princess Bubblegum; the Ice King; Marceline the Vampire Queen; Lumpy Space Princess; BMO; and Flame Princess.

        <h2>Why to watch it</h2>
        <p>Honestly I don't think there is a reason not to watch this show. It is 10 seasons long with around 24 episodes each (season 5 being an outlier with over 50). Every episode is an absolute blast with fast-paced and energetic writing that keeps you drawn in and laughing the whole time (unless they want to make you cry). Seasons 1-3 are a bit of a challenge to get through if you aren't used to the episodic nature of childrens' cartoons however the payoff from season four and onwards is worth every second.</p>
